            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Keith Hayden, a digital novelist with a passion for telling original stories with technology. 
                My journey as a writer started in 2004. That was the year I started journaling after my dad passed away from an unexpected stroke.
                Since then, I have been creating immersive worlds that blend technology with storytelling. 
                I believe in pushing the boundaries of traditional writing to create experiences that captivate readers in a age of acceleration.
            </p>
